this is a bump bot to "bump" messages on telegram

stop hopelessly pinging people to respond to you, you look desparate. have your bot do it instead.

if you want to run this:

- clone repo
- go to @BotFather on telegram and say /newbot
- get your key and make a .env with BOT_TOKEN=
- you can either manually run the python file bot.ts or host it on a server that does
- lmk if you need help. masonarditi@berkeley.edu
